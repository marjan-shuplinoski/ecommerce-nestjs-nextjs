# JWT Authentication Service and Strategy PRD

## Status
In Progress

## Overview
Implement robust JWT authentication in NestJS with access/refresh tokens, Passport JWT strategy, token validation, and notification integration. Strict typing, feature-sliced architecture, and project/global standards required. Full unit/integration test coverage. CI-ready.

## Features
- JWT service (access/refresh tokens)
- Passport JWT strategies (access, refresh)
- JWT guards
- Notification integration for all auth events
- Feature-sliced, strict TypeScript
- Jest unit/integration tests
- Documentation and CI-ready

## Task Status
- [x] Analyze requirements, dependencies, and architecture
- [x] Implement JWT service (core logic)
- [x] Implement Passport JWT strategies
- [x] Implement JWT guards
- [x] Wire up AuthModule and index.ts
- [x] Add Jest unit tests for all logic
- [ ] Add integration tests (if needed)
- [ ] Update README and documentation
- [ ] Final CI validation

## Traceability
- User model and Notification system dependencies complete
- All code and tests in `backend/src/features/auth/`

## Acceptance Criteria
- JWT service and strategy implemented
- Token validation present
- Notifications integrated
- Automated Jest tests and documentation are present and up to date

## Notes
- Follows all project and global standards
- Uses pnpm, strict TypeScript, feature-sliced structure
- All code linted and CI-ready
