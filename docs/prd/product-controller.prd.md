# Product Controller PRD

## Feature: Product Controller with Public and Admin Endpoints

### Status: In Progress

### Overview
Implements a feature-sliced NestJS controller for product catalog (public) and admin management endpoints. All endpoints return notification responses. Admin endpoints are protected by JWT and RBAC (admin only).

- `GET /products/:id` (public)
- `POST /products` (admin only)
- `PUT /products/:id` (admin only)
- `DELETE /products/:id` (admin only)

### Requirements
- Strict TypeScript, feature-sliced architecture
- Notification integration for all responses
- Full test coverage (unit/E2E)
- Documentation and OpenAPI decorators
- Lint and test must pass
