# Notification System Infrastructure - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
- **Status**: Completed
- **Priority**: P0
- **Target Release**: v1.0.0
- **Tech Lead**: @marjan
- **Created**: 2024-06-01
- **Last Updated**: 2025-07-03

## Problem Statement
The backend lacks a centralized, reusable notification system for consistent, color-coded user feedback and robust integration across all features.

## Goals & Objectives
- [x] Implement NotificationService in backend
- [x] Strict TypeScript and feature-sliced architecture
- [x] Color-coded (success, warning, error) notifications
- [x] Integration with all backend features/controllers
- [x] Automated Jest test coverage
- [x] Documentation and TODOs kept in sync

## Non-Goals
- Frontend notification UI
- Third-party notification providers

## User Stories
### As a developer, I want a reusable notification system so that all backend features provide consistent feedback
- [x] US-1: Centralized notification logic
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [x] NotificationService is reusable
    - [x] Color codes are enforced
    - [x] Integrated with backend features

## Technical Requirements
### Backend
- [x] Notification service in `backend/src/shared/notification.ts`
- [x] Types for notification payloads and color codes
- [x] Methods for success, warning, and error notifications
- [x] Integration with backend features/controllers
- [x] Automated Jest tests for all logic

### Frontend
- Not in scope

## Test Plan
### Unit Tests
- [x] NotificationService methods
### Integration Tests
- [x] Integration with backend features/controllers
### E2E Tests
- [ ] (Future)

## Dependencies
- None

## Open Questions
- [ ] Should notification payloads support localization?
- [ ] Should notification system support async/queue delivery?

## Metrics & Success Criteria
- [x] All backend features use NotificationService
- [x] 100% Jest test coverage for notification logic
- [x] Lint/type error free

## Rollback Plan
- Step 1: Revert NotificationService integration
- Step 2: Restore previous notification logic in features

## Additional Notes
- Strict TypeScript, feature-sliced, and CI-ready
- See `/backend/src/shared/notification.ts` and `/backend/src/shared/__tests__/notification.spec.ts`

## Traceability
- All tasks and features mapped in notification-system-infrastructure.todos.md

## Task Status
- [x] NotificationService implemented
- [x] Types and color codes added
- [x] Methods for all notification types
- [x] Integrated with backend features/controllers
- [x] Jest tests
- [x] Documentation finalization
