## Task Status
- Status: Done
- Owner: Backend Team
- Last Updated: 2025-07-02

## Requirements
- Use Mongoose with environment-driven URI (from `.env`)
- Validate all required environment variables with Joi
- Provide `/health` endpoint for DB health check
- All code must be feature-sliced, strict TypeScript, and CI-ready

## Acceptance Criteria
- Mongoose connects using env vars
- Joi validates all required env vars
- Health check endpoint works
- Automated Jest tests and documentation are present and up to date

## Traceability
- Related files: `backend/src/shared/config/`, `backend/src/shared/database/`, `backend/src/shared/health/`
- Related tasks: Jest tests, documentation sync

## Notes
- All environment variables must be documented in `.env.example`
- All changes must be reflected in README and TODOs
