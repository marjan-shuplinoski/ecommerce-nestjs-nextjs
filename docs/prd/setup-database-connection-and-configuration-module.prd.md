# Setup Database Connection and Configuration Module - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
- **Status**: Completed
- **Priority**: P0
- **Target Release**: v1.0.0
- **Tech Lead**: @marjan
- **Created**: 2024-06-01
- **Last Updated**: 2025-07-03

## Problem Statement
The backend requires robust, environment-driven MongoDB connection and configuration with strict validation, health checks, and CI/CD readiness.

## Goals & Objectives
- [x] Use Mongoose with environment-driven URI (from `.env`)
- [x] Validate all required environment variables with Joi
- [x] Provide `/health` endpoint for DB health check
- [x] Feature-sliced, strict TypeScript, and CI-ready
- [x] Automated Jest tests for all logic
- [x] Documentation and TODOs kept in sync

## Non-Goals
- Frontend database UI
- Support for non-MongoDB databases

## User Stories
### As a developer, I want reliable database connection and configuration so that the backend is stable and maintainable
- [x] US-1: Robust DB connection and health checks
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [x] Mongoose connects using env vars
    - [x] Joi validates all required env vars
    - [x] Health check endpoint works
    - [x] Automated Jest tests and documentation are present and up to date

## Technical Requirements
### Backend
- [x] Mongoose connection in `backend/src/shared/database/`
- [x] Joi validation in `backend/src/shared/config/`
- [x] Health check in `backend/src/shared/health/`
- [x] Full Jest test coverage

### Frontend
- Not in scope

## Test Plan
### Unit Tests
- [x] Config and database logic
### Integration Tests
- [x] Health check endpoint
### E2E Tests
- [ ] (Future)

## Dependencies
- None

## Open Questions
- [ ] Should DB connection support multi-tenant setups?
- [ ] Should health checks be extended for replica sets?

## Metrics & Success Criteria
- [x] All requirements implemented
- [x] 100% Jest test coverage
- [x] Lint/type error free

## Rollback Plan
- Step 1: Revert to previous database/configuration logic
- Step 2: Remove new health check endpoint

## Additional Notes
- All environment variables must be documented in `.env.example`
- All changes must be reflected in README and TODOs

## Traceability
- All tasks and features mapped in setup-database-connection-and-configuration-module.todos.md

## Task Status
- [x] Config/database/health modules implemented
- [x] Joi validation
- [x] Health check endpoint
- [x] Jest tests
- [x] Documentation finalization
