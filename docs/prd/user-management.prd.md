# User Management - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Priority**: P0
- **Target Release**: v1.0.0
- **Tech Lead**: @marjan
- **Created**: 2024-06-01

## Problem Statement
The backend requires secure, extensible user management including registration, authentication, profile management, and RBAC, with strict validation and test coverage.

## Goals & Objectives
- [x] Implement user schema and model
- [ ] Create authentication service and JWT strategy
- [ ] Add RBAC guards and decorators
- [ ] Profile management endpoints
- [ ] Automated Jest tests for all logic
- [ ] Documentation (PRD, TODO, README) synced

## Non-Goals
- Frontend user UI
- Social login integration

## User Stories
### As a user, I want to register, authenticate, and manage my profile so that I can securely use the platform
- [x] US-1: User registration and authentication
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [x] User schema/model implemented
    - [ ] Authentication service and JWT strategy
    - [ ] RBAC guards and decorators
    - [ ] Profile management endpoints
    - [ ] Automated Jest tests for all logic
    - [ ] Documentation synced

## Technical Requirements
### Backend
- [x] User schema/model
- [ ] Authentication service and JWT strategy
- [ ] RBAC guards and decorators
- [ ] Profile management endpoints
- [ ] Full Jest test coverage

### Frontend
- Not in scope

## Test Plan
### Unit Tests
- [x] User schema/model logic
### Integration Tests
- [ ] Authentication and RBAC
### E2E Tests
- [ ] (Future)

## Dependencies
- None

## Open Questions
- [ ] Should user management support OAuth providers?
- [ ] Should RBAC be role or permission-based?

## Metrics & Success Criteria
- [x] User schema/model implemented
- [ ] Authentication and RBAC logic complete
- [ ] 100% Jest test coverage
- [ ] Lint/type error free

## Rollback Plan
- Step 1: Revert to previous user management logic
- Step 2: Remove new endpoints and logic

## Additional Notes
- All tasks and subtasks are reflected in the matching TODO file.

## Traceability
- All tasks and features mapped in user-management.todos.md

## Task Status
- [x] User schema/model implemented
