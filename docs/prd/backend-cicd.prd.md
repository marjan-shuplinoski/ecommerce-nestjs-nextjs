# Backend CI/CD - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Priority:** P0
- **Target Release:** v1.0.0
- **Tech Lead:** @marjan
- **Created:** 2025-07-08

## Problem Statement
Manual backend deployment and testing is error-prone and not reproducible. Need automated, containerized CI/CD for backend.

## Goals & Objectives
- [x] Dockerfile for backend (pnpm, strict, prod-ready)
- [x] docker-compose for local/CI
- [x] .env.example for all required vars
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- [x] Lint, test, build, Docker build in CI
- [x] Documentation and test validation

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want to build, test, and deploy backend automatically with Docker and CI/CD so I can ship reliably.

## Technical Requirements
- Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, .env.example
- GitHub Actions workflow for lint, test, build, Docker
- pnpm as package manager
- All scripts CI-friendly
- Documentation in /docs/
- Tests for Docker/CI scripts

## Test Plan
- [x] CI runs lint, test, build, Docker build
- [x] All tests pass and are lint clean
- [x] .env.example covers all required vars

## Traceability
- All tasks and features mapped in backend-cicd.todos.md

## Task Status
- [x] Dockerfile
- [x] docker-compose.yml
- [x] .env.example
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow
- [x] Documentation
- [x] Test validation
