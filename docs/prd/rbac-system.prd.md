# RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) System PRD

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETED**

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for the NestJS backend with JWT authentication guards, roles guard, flexible RBAC decorators, notification integration, and complete test coverage. The system provides secure endpoint protection based on user roles (ADMIN, CUSTOMER, SELLER) with proper error handling and notification responses.

## Problem Statement
The application needs a robust authorization system that goes beyond basic authentication to control access based on user roles. Without RBAC, all authenticated users would have the same level of access, creating security vulnerabilities and preventing proper separation of concerns between different user types.

## Goals
- Implement secure role-based access control for all API endpoints
- Provide flexible decorators for different role combinations
- Integrate with existing notification system for consistent error responses
- Maintain strict TypeScript typing and follow project architecture patterns
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage and documentation
- Enable easy extension for future role additions

## User Stories
- **As an Admin**, I want exclusive access to administrative endpoints like user management
- **As a Customer**, I want access to customer-specific features like cart and orders
- **As a Seller**, I want access to seller-specific features like product management
- **As a Developer**, I want easy-to-use decorators for protecting endpoints with specific roles
- **As a System**, I want consistent error responses when unauthorized access is attempted

## Technical Requirements

### Core Components
1. **Enhanced JWT Authentication Guard**
   - Extends existing Passport JWT guard
   - Integrates with NotificationService for unauthorized responses
   - Maintains strict TypeScript typing

2. **Comprehensive Roles Guard**
   - Validates user roles against required permissions
   - Uses NestJS Reflector for metadata access
   - Provides detailed error messages with notification integration

3. **Flexible RBAC Decorators**
   - `@Roles(role1, role2, ...)` - General role specification
   - `@AdminOnly` - Admin-only access convenience decorator
   - `@CustomerOnly` - Customer-only access convenience decorator
   - `@SellerOnly` - Seller-only access convenience decorator
   - `@AdminOrSeller` - Admin or Seller access combination
   - `@AllRoles` - All authenticated users access

4. **Module Integration**
   - Update AuthModule to provide and export all RBAC components
   - Ensure NotificationService availability for guards
   - Maintain clean exports through index files

5. **Controller Implementation**
   - Update controllers to use RBAC guards and decorators
   - Demonstrate proper usage patterns
   - Maintain existing functionality while adding security

### Implementation Details
- **Architecture**: Feature-sliced design within auth module
- **Dependencies**: NotificationService, Reflector, existing JWT infrastructure
- **Error Handling**: Consistent ForbiddenException and UnauthorizedException with notifications
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript with proper interfaces and enums

## Test Plan

### Unit Testing
- âœ… JWT Authentication Guard tests with notification mocking
- âœ… Roles Guard tests covering all role scenarios
- âœ… RBAC Decorators tests verifying metadata setting
- âœ… Controller tests with proper guard mocking

### Integration Testing
- âœ… End-to-end authentication flow with role validation
- âœ… User Profile Controller with RBAC integration
- âœ… Error scenarios and notification responses

### Test Coverage
- âœ… 100% coverage for all RBAC components
- âœ… All 185 tests passing including existing functionality
- âœ… Edge cases and error conditions covered

## Task Status

### âœ… Completed Tasks
- [x] Enhanced JWT Authentication Guard with notification integration
- [x] Implemented comprehensive Roles Guard with role validation
- [x] Created flexible RBAC decorators (@Roles, @AdminOnly, etc.)
- [x] Updated AuthModule for proper dependency injection
- [x] Updated index files for clean exports
- [x] Enhanced UserProfileController with RBAC decorators
- [x] Created comprehensive unit tests for all RBAC components
- [x] Fixed controller tests with proper guard mocking
- [x] Verified all tests pass (185/185)
- [x] Created RBAC system documentation

### ðŸ“‹ Implementation Files
- `backend/src/features/auth/guards/jwt-auth.guard.ts` - Enhanced JWT guard
- `backend/src/features/auth/guards/roles.guard.ts` - Role validation guard
- `backend/src/features/auth/decorators/roles.decorator.ts` - RBAC decorators
- `backend/src/features/auth/auth.module.ts` - Module configuration
- `backend/src/features/auth/index.ts` - Clean exports
- `backend/src/features/user/controllers/user-profile.controller.ts` - RBAC usage
- Test files: `*.spec.ts` for all components

## Traceability
- **Dependencies**: Built on existing JWT authentication, User schema, and Notification system
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing Passport JWT strategies
- **Usage**: Demonstrated in UserProfileController admin endpoints
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite validates all functionality
- **Documentation**: Complete PRD and TODO documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- âœ… JWT Authentication Guard enhanced with notification responses
- âœ… Roles Guard implemented with comprehensive role validation
- âœ… Flexible RBAC decorators created for different use cases
- âœ… AuthModule properly configured with all dependencies
- âœ… UserProfileController updated to use RBAC system
- âœ… All tests passing with 100% coverage for RBAC components
- âœ… Strict TypeScript typing maintained throughout
- âœ… Feature-sliced architecture followed
- âœ… Notification system integrated for consistent error responses
- âœ… Documentation complete and up-to-date

## Future Enhancements
- Permission-based access control for more granular security
- Role hierarchy system for inherited permissions
- Dynamic role assignment and management
- Audit logging for role-based access events
- Multi-tenant role isolation

## Security Considerations
- All role checks performed server-side with proper validation
- JWT tokens required for role-based endpoints
- Detailed error messages without sensitive information leakage
- Proper exception handling with notification integration
- No client-side role validation dependencies
